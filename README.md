A Pacman Game made in Unity3D, a demo for applying the PSO algorithm where ghosts movements are the individual best points and the pacman movement is the global best point.

These tutorials from [noobtuts](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game), [the original AI](http://pacman.shaunew.com/play/index.htm) and [Game Internals](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior) helped us to implement this project.
